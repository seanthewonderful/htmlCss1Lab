    <h1>The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch</h1>
    <div class="center-cropped"></div>
    <h2>Book of Armaments 2:9-21</h2>
        <p>And Saint Attila raised the hand grenade up on high, saying, 'O Lord, bless this thy hand grenade, that with it thou mayst blow thine enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy.' And the Lord did grin. And the people did feast upon the lambs, and sloths, and carp, and anchovies, and orangutans, and breakfast cereals, and fruit bats, and large chulapas. And the Lord spake, saying, 'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin. Then shalt thou count to three, no more, no less. Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in My sight, shall snuff it.</p>
    <h2>"Thou art the Grenade's keeper"</h2>
    <h3>Brother Maynard: An Introduction</h3>
        <p>Of the precarious deliverance of the Holy Hand Grenade, Brother Maynard later stated:
            <figure>
                <blockquote cite="https://montypython.fandom.com/wiki/Brother_Maynard">
                    <p>Lo and I beheld myself in the dark and expensive forest, when the Lord God almighty did shine through all the branches, and the foliage, and the shrubberies, and He said unto me, "Maynard, thou art chosen. Take thee mine Holy Grenade, made for the hands of men, and let the King declare whence it shall be used. Amen." And I did know. And we did overcome our enemy. And amen.</p>

    <h3>Arthur: Man, Myth, Lover, Hurler of the Holy 'Nade</h3>

        <p>True it is that God chose Maynard for the holy task of guarding the Grenade, but it was Arthur, King of the Britons, who dared call down the wrath of the Lord God upon the Rabbit, and he did un-pin God's Holy Grenade, and he did hurl it with faith and with righteous fury, and he did verily explode his foe into tiny bits, and the Lord did smile when he saw it. For the Lord delights in the faith of men and in the explosive power of his instruments of death.
        <br>Even as Arthur counted more than three, which was the exact number to be counted, the Lord God did smile and did inspire Lancelot, and he corrected his King, and thusly made operational the Holy Hand Grenade.</p>
    <h3>Victims of the Holy Hand Grenade</h3>
        <p>Only one has fallen to the divine power of the Holy Hand Grenade, and never since has there been a more viscious foe worthy of the explosive power of God's shrapnel.
        <br>The Rabbit of Caerbannog had already claimed the lives of dozens of Arthur's Knights before he made his ultimate choice to call forth Brother Maynard.
        <br>Capable of leaping on a bee-line from great distances, the Rabbit of Caerbannog often took his victims by total surprise, even when attacking from the front. His rabbit-like speed and soft fluff allowed for the most swift attacks men have ever known. With razor-sharp teeth, his victims were often decapitated before realizing they were even being attacked.
        <br>Though secretive until the end, the Rabbit of Caerbannog was known to Tim, the great Enchanter of the lands of East Anglia, who warned Arthur and his knights of the hopelessness of their quest to kill the Rabbit. Such a passionate teller of tales was he, that even Sir Robin the Brave soiled his armour out of fright.
